    )
Description: Production-ready R package for processing airborne lidar point clouds
    to quantify habitat structure for culturally important wildlife species (moose,
    caribou, deer, bear, salmon). Implements scientifically defensible methods from
    peer-reviewed literature to calculate canopy and understory metrics, detect and
    model individual trees in 3D, assess species-specific habitat suitability, and
    generate automated reports with visualizations for conservation planning and
    community engagement.
