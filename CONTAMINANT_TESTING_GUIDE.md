## Overview

This guide helps practitioners integrate soil contaminant testing with carbon monitoring for Indigenous agriculture restoration projects in Canada. The goal is to ensure that restored lands are safe for growing food, medicines, and culturally important plants while maintaining efficient, integrated sampling protocols.

### Key Principles

1. **Precautionary Approach** - When land-use history is uncertain, test for contaminants
2. **Sample Integration** - Use the same soil samples for carbon and contaminant analysis when possible
3. **Cultural Safety** - Prioritize food sovereignty and cultural use considerations
4. **Cost-Effective Design** - Strategic composite sampling reduces costs while maintaining safety
5. **Clear Communication** - Provide results in plain language for community decision-making

## When to Test for Contaminants

### HIGH PRIORITY - Always Test If:

- **Urban or peri-urban sites** (within 500m of urban development)
- **Adjacent to roads or highways** (within 100m of major roads, 50m of minor roads)
- **Former industrial areas** (any industrial activity within 500m)
- **Near rail corridors** (within 200m of active or historic railways)
- **Former landfills or dumps** (within 1 km)
- **Downstream of mining activities**
- **Agricultural lands with intensive historical use** (especially orchards, nurseries)
- **Areas with visible contamination** (staining, odors, stressed vegetation)
- **Floodplains** (can concentrate upstream contaminants)
- **Former military or government facility sites**

### MEDIUM PRIORITY - Consider Testing If:

- **Agricultural lands with moderate historic use**
- **Proximity to older buildings** (lead-based paint, asbestos)
- **Areas with buried fill or altered topography**
- **Near former fuel storage or service stations** (within 500m)
- **Uncertainty about land-use history**
- **Growing food crops for vulnerable populations** (children, pregnant women)

### LOW PRIORITY - Baseline Testing:

- **Remote sites with no development history**
- **Natural wetlands with minimal human disturbance**
- **Sites with comprehensive clean environmental assessments**

## Risk-Based Decision Trees

### Decision Tree 1: Do I Need Contaminant Testing?

```
START: Planning Indigenous agriculture restoration

↓
Known clean site with documentation?
  ├─ YES → Proceed with baseline testing only (optional)
  └─ NO → Continue

↓
Within 500m of urban/industrial development?
  ├─ YES → HIGH PRIORITY - Test Core Suite
  └─ NO → Continue

↓
Within 100m of roads/railways?
  ├─ YES → HIGH PRIORITY - Test Metals + PAHs + PHCs
  └─ NO → Continue

↓

↓
DECISION: Proceed with appropriate testing level
```

### Decision Tree 2: What Depth to Sample for Contaminants?

```
START: Designing contaminant sampling depth

↓
What crops will be grown?

ROOT VEGETABLES (carrots, potatoes, beets)?
  → Sample 0-30 cm (primary rooting zone)

LEAFY GREENS (lettuce, kale, chard)?
  → Sample 0-15 cm (main uptake zone)

MEDICINES & HERBS?
  → Sample 0-30 cm + consider 30-50 cm for deep-rooted species

BERRIES & SHRUBS?
  → Sample 0-50 cm (deep feeder roots)

TREES (fruit, nut)?
  → Sample 0-50 cm AND 50-100 cm for long-term assessment

↓
Also sample surface separately (0-5 cm) if:
  - Dust/ingestion pathway concerns
  - Surface application history (pesticides)
  - Depositional sources (road dust, atmospheric)

↓
IMPORTANT: Contaminant sampling must include same depths as carbon sampling
for integrated analysis
```

### Decision Tree 3: Composite vs. Discrete Sampling

```
START: Determining sample collection strategy

↓
Is this initial site characterization?
  ├─ YES → Use COMPOSITE samples to reduce cost
  │         (Combine 5-10 subsamples per stratum)
  └─ NO → Continue

↓
Is contamination expected to be uniform across site?
  ├─ YES → COMPOSITE sampling appropriate
  └─ NO → Continue

↓
Are there visible hotspots or contamination evidence?
  ├─ YES → Use DISCRETE samples for hotspots
  │         + Composite for background areas
  └─ NO → Continue

↓
Are you characterizing for detailed risk assessment or remediation?
  ├─ YES → Use DISCRETE samples (individual locations)
  └─ NO → COMPOSITE appropriate

↓
Budget constraints?
  ├─ TIGHT → Composite maximum areas (up to 2000 m² for screening)
  ├─ MODERATE → Composite by stratum (standard approach)
  └─ ADEQUATE → Discrete samples for high-resolution mapping

↓
DECISION: Select appropriate strategy
```

## CCME Standards Interpretation

### Understanding CCME Soil Quality Guidelines

The **Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment (CCME)** provides Soil Quality Guidelines for the Protection of Environmental and Human Health. These are risk-based concentrations developed specifically for Canadian conditions.

#### Land Use Categories

For Indigenous agriculture restoration, the relevant categories are:

**1. Agricultural (AG)**
- Use this category for land where food crops will be grown
- Most conservative thresholds
- Protects human health via food consumption pathway
- Protects livestock health
- Considers soil-to-plant transfer

**2. Residential/Parkland (RES)**
- Use for areas with community gardens, gathering spaces
- Protects human health from direct soil contact
- Considers children's exposure (hand-to-mouth behavior)
- More conservative than Commercial/Industrial

**3. Commercial (COM) / Industrial (IND)**
- NOT appropriate for agriculture or food production
- Only use for infrastructure, parking, or non-food areas

### Key CCME Agricultural Thresholds (Summary Table)

| **Contaminant** | **CCME AG (mg/kg)** | **Health Concerns** | **Uptake Notes** |
|----------------|---------------------|---------------------|------------------|
| **Arsenic** | 12 | Cancer, skin lesions | High uptake in rice, leafy greens |
| **Cadmium** | 1.4 | Kidney damage | Very high uptake in leafy vegetables |
| **Chromium (total)** | 64 | Cr(VI) is carcinogenic | Low plant uptake |
| **Chromium (VI)** | 0.4 | Cancer | Specify Cr(VI) analysis if industrial history |
| **Copper** | 63 | Plant toxicity | Moderate uptake, fungicide residue |
| **Lead** | 70 | Neurotoxic (children) | Low plant uptake, dust ingestion main risk |
| **Mercury** | 6.6 | Neurotoxic | Low uptake, bioaccumulates |
| **Zinc** | 200 | Plant toxicity | Moderate uptake |
| **PAHs (total)** | 10 (carcinogenic) | Cancer | Low uptake, skin contact risk |
| **PCBs** | 0.5 | Cancer, immune effects | Moderate uptake in root vegetables |
| **PHC F1** | 210 | Acute toxicity | Volatile, evaporates |
| **PHC F2** | 150 | Plant toxicity | Most mobile fraction |
| **PHC F3** | 300 | Plant toxicity | Less mobile |
| **PHC F4** | 2800 | Limited toxicity | Very low mobility |

### How to Interpret Lab Results

#### Step 1: Compare to CCME Agricultural Guidelines

```
IF concentration < CCME AG threshold:
  → SAFE for agricultural use
  → Proceed with restoration

IF concentration = 1-2x CCME AG threshold:
  → CAUTION zone
  → Consider crop selection (avoid high-uptake species)
  → Consider amended soils for raised beds
  → May proceed with monitoring

IF concentration > 2x CCME AG threshold:
  → UNSAFE for food production
  → Consider remediation before planting
  → Or restrict to non-food plants
```

#### Step 2: Consider Multiple Contaminants

**Additive Effects**:
- If multiple contaminants exceed 50% of their individual guidelines, cumulative risk increases
- Use precautionary approach

**Example**:
```
Site Results:
- Lead: 45 mg/kg (64% of guideline)
- Arsenic: 8 mg/kg (67% of guideline)
- Cadmium: 0.9 mg/kg (64% of guideline)

Interpretation:
- All below guidelines individually
- But combined, multiple contaminants at 60-70% of thresholds
- RECOMMENDATION: Caution zone - use raised beds with clean soil
```

#### Step 3: Depth Considerations

```
IF contamination is surface-only (0-15 cm):
  → Can physically remove/replace surface soil
  → Or use raised beds
  → Easier to manage

IF contamination extends to depth (>30 cm):
  → More challenging to remediate
  → Consider phytoremediation
  → Or restrict land use
```

### Provincial Variations

**British Columbia**:
- Use BC Contaminated Sites Regulation (CSR) standards
- Generally aligned with CCME but may have additional substances
- BC Ministry of Environment oversees site-specific assessments

**Alberta**:
- Alberta Tier 1 Guidelines
- Similar to CCME with some regional adjustments

**Ontario**:
- Ontario Soil, Ground Water and Sediment Standards (O. Reg 153/04)
- Table 1: Agricultural/Residential/Parkland

**Always check your provincial guidelines for the most current and applicable standards.**

## Integrated Sampling Protocol

### Co-Collection Strategy for Carbon + Contaminant Analysis

This protocol enables you to collect ONE soil core that serves BOTH carbon monitoring and contaminant assessment, maximizing efficiency.

#### Field Equipment Checklist

**Standard Carbon Sampling Equipment**:
- Soil core sampler (Russian peat corer, gouge auger, or split-spoon)
- Depth markers/measuring tape
- Sample bags (for carbon analysis)

**Additional for Contaminant Sampling**:
- Clean stainless steel or high-density polyethylene (HDPE) tools
- Disposable nitrile gloves (change between samples)
- Pre-cleaned glass jars (for VOCs/POPs) OR clean plastic bags (for metals/PHCs)
- Cooler with ice packs
- Chain-of-custody forms
- Decontamination supplies (distilled water, brushes, methanol wipes)

#### Sample Collection Protocol (Integrated)

**Step 1: Site Preparation**
- Mark sampling location with GPS
- Document site conditions (vegetation, observations, odors)
- Photograph location

**Step 2: Core Extraction**
- Use clean, decontaminated corer
- Extract full core (0-100 cm for VM0033 compliance)
- Keep core intact and vertical

**Step 3: Core Processing for Multiple Analyses**

For each depth interval (e.g., 0-15 cm, 15-30 cm, 30-50 cm, 50-100 cm):

```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│    MASTER CORE (one extraction) │
└─────────────────────────────────┘
           │
           ▼
    [Homogenize depth interval]
           │
           ├────────────────────────┐
           │                        │
           ▼                        ▼
    [Subsample 1]              [Subsample 2]
    CARBON ANALYSIS            CONTAMINANT ANALYSIS
    (~500g)                    (~250g)
    │                          │
    ├─ SOC concentration       ├─ Metals
    ├─ Bulk density            ├─ PAHs
    ├─ Texture (optional)      ├─ PHCs
    ├─ pH (optional)           └─ PCBs (if required)
    └─ Nutrients (optional)
```

**Step 4: Subsample Allocation**

From each homogenized depth interval:

**Subsample 1 - Carbon/Soil Health** (~500g):
- Store in clean plastic bag
- Label: Site_Core#_Depth_Carbon
- Keep refrigerated (4°C)
- Send to soil carbon lab

**Subsample 2 - Contaminants** (~250-500g, depending on analyses):
- Store in appropriate container (see below)
- Label: Site_Core#_Depth_Contaminant
- Keep cool (4°C)
- Send to environmental lab

**Container Requirements by Analyte**:
| **Analysis** | **Container** | **Volume** | **Preservation** |
|-------------|--------------|-----------|-----------------|
| Metals | Plastic bag or jar | 250g | Cool (4°C) |
| PAHs | Amber glass jar | 250g | Cool (4°C), dark |
| PCBs | Amber glass jar | 250g | Cool (4°C), dark |
| PHCs | Glass jar | 250g | Cool (4°C) |
| VOCs | 40mL VOA vial (no headspace) | 40g | Cool (4°C), immediate |
| OCPs | Amber glass jar | 250g | Cool (4°C), dark |
| PFAS | HDPE bottle (NO glass) | 250g | Cool (4°C) |

**Step 5: Field Documentation**

Record on field sheet:
- Sample ID
- GPS coordinates (WGS84)
- Stratum assignment
- Depth intervals collected
- Subsamples taken (carbon, contaminants, other)
- Field observations (color, texture, odor, roots, redox features)
- Date and time
- Sampler name

**Step 6: Decontamination Between Samples**

Critical to prevent cross-contamination:
1. Brush off visible soil
2. Wash with distilled water
3. Wipe with methanol (for organic contaminants)
4. Triple-rinse with distilled water
5. Air dry or wipe with clean paper towel

**NEVER reuse disposable items (gloves, sample bags).**

#### Composite Sampling for Cost Reduction

For initial site characterization, composite sampling reduces lab costs:

**How to Create a Composite Sample**:

1. Divide site into homogeneous strata (same land use, vegetation, topography)
2. Within each stratum, collect 5-10 subsamples at random or systematic locations
3. For each subsample, extract soil from target depth
4. Combine all subsamples into clean bucket
5. Homogenize thoroughly
6. Take 250-500g aliquot for lab analysis

**When Compositing is Appropriate**:
- Initial screening
- Uniform site conditions expected
- Budget constraints
- Area < 2000 m² per composite

**When to Use Discrete Samples**:
- Hotspot investigation
- Detailed risk assessment
- Site has visible contamination gradients
- Regulatory requirement for discrete locations

#### Sampling Depth Strategy for Different Crops

| **Crop Type** | **Primary Sampling Depth** | **Secondary Depth (if budget allows)** |
|--------------|---------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Leafy greens | 0-15 cm | 15-30 cm |
| Root vegetables | 0-30 cm | 30-50 cm |
| Berries/shrubs | 0-50 cm | - |
| Trees | 0-50 cm | 50-100 cm |
| Medicines (variable) | 0-30 cm | 30-50 cm |

**For VM0033 carbon compliance**: You must sample to 100 cm depth anyway, so contaminant subsamples from the same core add minimal field effort.

#### Sample Preservation and Holding Times

| **Analyte** | **Holding Time** | **Preservation** |
|------------|-----------------|------------------|
| Metals | 6 months | Cool, 4°C |
| PAHs | 14 days (extract within) | Cool, 4°C, dark |
| PCBs | 14 days (extract within) | Cool, 4°C, dark |
| PHCs | 14 days | Cool, 4°C |
| VOCs | 7 days | Cool, 4°C, no headspace |
| OCPs | 14 days (extract within) | Cool, 4°C, dark |
| PFAS | 28 days | Cool, 4°C |

**Submit samples to lab as soon as possible after collection.**

- 6 samples × $300 = $1,800

Add 10% for shipping and chain-of-custody: $180
Add QA/QC samples (1 duplicate, 1 blank): $600

Total Estimated Cost: $2,580
```

### Detection Limits and Data Quality

**Request Method Detection Limits (MDLs) that are below CCME guidelines**:

| **Analyte** | **CCME AG Guideline** | **Required MDL** | **Typical Lab MDL** |
|------------|----------------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Arsenic | 12 mg/kg | <1.2 mg/kg | 0.5 mg/kg ✓ |
| Cadmium | 1.4 mg/kg | <0.14 mg/kg | 0.05 mg/kg ✓ |
| Lead | 70 mg/kg | <7 mg/kg | 1 mg/kg ✓ |
| Mercury | 6.6 mg/kg | <0.66 mg/kg | 0.05 mg/kg ✓ |
| PCBs (total) | 0.5 mg/kg | <0.05 mg/kg | 0.01 mg/kg ✓ |
| PAH (BaP) | 0.7 mg/kg | <0.07 mg/kg | 0.05 mg/kg ✓ |

**If lab MDLs are above required levels, request lower detection limits or find a different lab.**

---

## Interpreting Results

### Step-by-Step Result Interpretation

#### Step 1: Review Lab QA/QC

Before interpreting results, check:
- **Blank contamination**: Should be <MDL
- **Duplicate precision**: Relative Percent Difference (RPD) <20%
- **Spike recovery**: 70-130% (method dependent)
- **Surrogate recovery**: 70-130%

If QA/QC fails, samples may need re-analysis.

#### Step 2: Identify Exceedances

For each analyte:
```
Result < CCME AG guideline → ✓ PASS
Result = 1-2x CCME AG → ⚠ CAUTION
Result > 2x CCME AG → ✗ FAIL
```

#### Step 3: Spatial and Depth Patterns

Create summary tables:

**Example Summary Table**:

| **Location** | **Stratum** | **Depth (cm)** | **Lead (mg/kg)** | **Arsenic (mg/kg)** | **Cadmium (mg/kg)** |
|-------------|-----------|--------------|-----------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Site A | Upper Marsh | 0-15 | 125 ✗ | 8.2 ✓ | 0.6 ✓ |
| Site A | Upper Marsh | 15-30 | 45 ✓ | 5.1 ✓ | 0.3 ✓ |
| Site B | Lower Marsh | 0-15 | 35 ✓ | 15.2 ✗ | 0.9 ✓ |

**Interpretation**:
- Lead exceedance at Site A surface (0-15 cm) - likely roadside deposition
- Arsenic exceedance at Site B surface - investigate pesticide history
- Contamination is surface-only (decreases with depth) - manageable

#### Step 4: Bioavailability Considerations

**Not all contaminants in soil are equally available to plants.**

Factors affecting bioavailability:
- **pH**: Low pH increases metal mobility (especially Cd, Zn, Cu)
- **Organic matter**: High OM binds metals, reducing uptake
- **Clay content**: Clay binds metals
- **Soil type**: Sandy soils have higher mobility than clay
- **Speciation**: Cr(VI) vs Cr(III), As(III) vs As(V)

**For arsenic specifically**:
- Request **arsenic speciation** if total As is elevated
- As(V) is less toxic and mobile than As(III)

**For lead**:
- Lead has low plant uptake
- Main risk is dust ingestion, especially for children
- Surface soil lead is higher concern than deep lead

#### Step 5: Crop-Specific Risk Assessment

**High Uptake Crops** (avoid if contaminants elevated):
- **Cadmium**: Leafy greens (lettuce, spinach, chard), root vegetables
- **Arsenic**: Rice, leafy greens
- **Copper**: Leafy greens

**Low Uptake Crops** (safer choices if marginal exceedances):
- **Lead**: Fruit trees, berries (fruit flesh has low uptake)
- **Most metals**: Tree nuts, grains (low translocation to grain)

#### Step 6: Decision Matrix

| **Scenario** | **Recommendation** |
|-------------|-------------------|
| All results <50% of guideline | Proceed with restoration, all crops suitable |
| Results 50-100% of guideline | Proceed with caution, avoid high-uptake crops |
| Results 100-200% of guideline (1-2x) | Use amended soil/raised beds, restricted crop list |
| Results >200% of guideline (>2x) | Remediation required OR non-food use only |
| Localized hotspot | Remove/isolate contaminated soil, test surroundings |

---

## Restoration Planning Based on Results

### Scenario 1: Clean Site (All Results Pass)

**Action Plan**:
1. Proceed with restoration as planned
2. Document baseline contaminant levels for future monitoring
3. All crops and cultural plants suitable
4. Maintain organic matter and pH to keep metals immobile

**Monitoring**:
- Re-test every 5-10 years as part of MMRV cycle
- Test if land use changes or new contamination suspected

---

### Scenario 2: Marginal Exceedances (1-2x Guidelines)

**Action Plan**:
1. Restrict high-uptake crops (see lists above)
2. Use soil amendments to reduce bioavailability:
   - **Lime**: Raise pH to 6.5-7.0 (reduces Cd, Pb, Zn uptake)
   - **Compost**: Increase organic matter (binds metals)
   - **Phosphate**: Binds lead (if Pb is main concern)
3. Consider raised beds with clean soil (60+ cm deep)
4. Focus on fruit-bearing crops (low metal translocation to fruit)

**Monitoring**:
- Test crops (tissue analysis) to verify low uptake
- Re-test soil annually for first 3 years to confirm stability

### Scenario 3: Significant Exceedances (>2x Guidelines)

**Action Plan**:
1. **Do not plant food crops** until remediation complete
2. Consult with environmental professional for remediation plan
3. Options:
   - **Excavation and replacement**: Remove contaminated soil (0-30 cm typically)
   - **Phytoremediation**: Use hyperaccumulator plants (long-term, 5-10 years)
   - **Soil washing**: Chemical extraction (expensive, off-site)
   - **Stabilization**: Amendments to immobilize (not remove) contaminants
4. Implement interim use restrictions

**Monitoring**:
- Verify remediation effectiveness with post-remediation testing
- Test at higher frequency (annually) until stable

---

### Scenario 4: Surface Contamination Only (0-15 cm)

**Action Plan**:
1. Most cost-effective remediation: **Remove and replace surface soil**
2. Excavate 0-20 cm, dispose properly
3. Replace with certified clean topsoil (test before importing!)
4. Replant immediately

**Cost**: ~$20-40/m² (depending on disposal requirements)

---

### Scenario 5: Hotspot Contamination (Localized)

**Action Plan**:
1. Delineate extent of hotspot with additional discrete samples
2. Isolate area (fence, signage)
3. Remove hotspot soil
4. Test surrounding areas to confirm contamination is contained
5. Proceed with restoration in clean areas

### Phytoremediation Options for Long-Term Management

If active remediation is not feasible, consider phytoremediation using **hyperaccumulator plants**:

**Metal Hyperaccumulators**:
- **Lead**: Sunflowers (*Helianthus annuus*), Indian mustard (*Brassica juncea*)
- **Arsenic**: Chinese brake fern (*Pteris vittata*) - very effective
- **Cadmium**: Willow (*Salix* sp.), alpine pennycress (*Noccaea caerulescens*)
- **Copper**: Indian mustard, sunflowers
- **Zinc**: Indian mustard, alpine pennycress

**Process**:
1. Plant hyperaccumulators densely
2. Allow 1-2 growing seasons
3. Harvest above-ground biomass (contains extracted metals)
4. Dispose of biomass as hazardous waste (do not compost!)
5. Repeat for 5-10 years

**Limitations**:
- Slow (years to decades)
- Only effective for surface contamination (0-30 cm rooting depth)
- Not suitable for all metals (ineffective for Hg, poor for Pb)
- Requires long-term commitment

### Soil Amendments to Reduce Bioavailability

**Lime (CaCO₃)**:
- Raises pH → reduces Cd, Pb, Zn, Cu uptake
- Target pH: 6.5-7.0
- Application rate: Test soil pH first, typically 2-5 tonnes/ha
- Re-test pH annually

**Compost (high-quality, uncontaminated)**:
- Increases organic matter → binds metals
- Improves soil structure
- Application rate: 50-100 tonnes/ha (5-10 cm layer)
- CRITICAL: Test compost for contaminants before applying!

**Phosphate Amendments (for Lead)**:
- Forms stable Pb-phosphate minerals (pyromorphite)
- Use rock phosphate or bone meal
- Application rate: 1-2 tonnes/ha
- Most effective at pH 6-7

**Biochar**:
- High surface area → adsorbs metals and organics
- Stable, long-lasting
- Application rate: 10-20 tonnes/ha
- Ensure biochar is from clean source

**Iron/Manganese Oxides**:
- Effective for As(V) immobilization
- Use iron filings or ferric chloride
- Application rate: site-specific, consult specialist

## Cultural and Food Sovereignty Considerations

### Community Engagement and Communication

**Transparency**:
- Share all lab results with community in plain language
- Avoid technical jargon; use interpretive summaries
- Hold community meetings to discuss results and options

**Decision-Making**:
- Community should decide on acceptable risk levels
- Provide information, not prescriptions
- Respect traditional knowledge about plant health and site history

**Cultural Safety**:
- Recognize that contamination can be a barrier to cultural revitalization
- Frame remediation as healing the land, not just cleaning soil
- Engage Elders and knowledge holders in planning

### Prioritizing Culturally Important Species

When contamination limits crop options, prioritize:
1. **Medicines** first (often smaller harvest areas, can use cleanest sites)
2. **Ceremonial plants** (cultural significance)
3. **Food sovereignty crops** (staples like berries, roots)

### Precautionary Approach

**For vulnerable populations**:
- **Children**: Lower exposure thresholds (developing brains, hand-to-mouth)
- **Pregnant women**: Avoid Pb, Hg, As
- **Elders**: May have cumulative exposures

**Use extra caution (test more, restrict more) when growing food for:**
- Daycare/school gardens
- Community feasts (large gatherings)
- Elder meal programs

### Traditional Food Preparation Considerations

Some preparation methods reduce contaminant exposure:
- **Washing**: Removes surface dust/lead (up to 50% reduction)
- **Peeling**: Removes outer layer (where Pb concentrates)
- **Cooking water**: Discard (leaches some Cd, As)

**Do not rely on preparation to make unsafe food safe** - better to avoid growing high-risk crops on contaminated sites.
