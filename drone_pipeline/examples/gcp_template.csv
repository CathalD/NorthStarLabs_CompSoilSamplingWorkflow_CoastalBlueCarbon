# Ground Control Points Template
# Format: gcp_id, latitude, longitude, elevation_m
# Use high-precision GPS (RTK or survey-grade) to collect GCP coordinates
# Place at least 5 GCPs distributed throughout survey area
# Mark GCPs with visible targets (checkerboard panels, painted markers)
#
# Example coordinates (replace with your actual GCP measurements):

gcp_id,latitude,longitude,elevation_m
GCP_001,49.2827,-123.1207,125.34
GCP_002,49.2835,-123.1195,126.12
GCP_003,49.2842,-123.1210,124.87
GCP_004,49.2838,-123.1222,125.56
GCP_005,49.2830,-123.1218,125.91

# Notes:
# - GCP coordinates must be in WGS84 (EPSG:4326) decimal degrees
# - Elevation in meters above sea level
# - More GCPs = higher accuracy (10-15 recommended for large areas)
# - Distribute GCPs around perimeter and center of survey area
# - Avoid clustering GCPs in one corner
# - GCPs improve absolute positional accuracy but not required for relative measurements
